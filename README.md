## Introduction

This repository contains the comprehensive implementation of various deep learning approaches for movie recommendation systems, developed as part of an assignment for the Deep Learning course at the University of Deusto. The project represents an in-depth exploration of modern neural network architectures applied to collaborative filtering and recommendation systems.

The implementation explores different neural network architectures for predicting user movie ratings using the **MovieLens 100k dataset**. Since the implementation was carried out on a personal laptop, the MovieLens 100k dataset was chosen to avoid unfeasible training times that would occur with larger datasets. Therefore, different results might be obtained when using larger datasets such as MovieLens 1M or 10M.

All PyTorch implementations can be found in the `src/` directory, the best performing models are stored in the `checkpoints/` directory, and several plots with comprehensive performance metrics are located in the `plots/` directory. The project demonstrates both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of state-of-the-art recommendation algorithms.

## Model Architecture

After an initial exploration of existing methods, **Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)** was selected as the primary approach for developing the proposed Recommendation System. This decision was based on NCF's proven ability to capture complex, non-linear interactions between users and films, representing a significant advancement over traditional collaborative filtering methods.

### Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)

NCF is a deep learning architecture that fundamentally improves traditional collaborative filtering by leveraging neural networks to model user-item interactions. Its primary objective is to predict a user's discrete rating (from 1 to 5) based on historical data, moving beyond the limitations of conventional approaches.

**Key Advantages over Traditional Methods:**
- **Non-linear Modeling**: Unlike conventional methods such as matrix factorization, which rely on linear relationships, NCF employs neural networks to learn intricate patterns between users and films
- **Embedding Learning**: Users and films are represented by low-dimensional embedding vectors that are learned during training, encapsulating latent features that influence user preferences
- **Complex Interaction Modeling**: Instead of simple inner products, NCF processes embeddings through multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with non-linear activations like ReLU, allowing the model to capture higher-order interactions

**Technical Foundation:**
The core innovation of NCF lies in its ability to replace the traditional inner product operation in matrix factorization with a neural architecture that can learn arbitrary functions from data. This approach enables the model to capture complex, non-linear user-item relationships that linear methods cannot represent.

### NeuMF Hybrid Architecture

The implementation adopted in this project utilizes a sophisticated hybrid architecture known as **NeuMF (Neural Matrix Factorization)**, which strategically combines two complementary branches to leverage both linear and non-linear modeling capabilities.

#### Architecture Components:

**1. Generalized Matrix Factorization (GMF) Branch:**
- Extends traditional matrix factorization by modeling linear interactions
- Utilizes element-wise product of user and film embeddings
- Captures basic relationships between users and items
- Preserves the interpretability of traditional collaborative filtering
- Provides a foundation for understanding fundamental user-item affinities

**2. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Branch:**
- Processes concatenated user and item embeddings through several fully connected layers
- Employs non-linear activation functions to learn complex patterns
- Captures higher-order interactions that linear methods cannot model
- Enables the discovery of latent factors and subtle preference patterns
- Uses progressive dimensionality reduction through hidden layers

**3. Fusion Layer:**
- Concatenates outputs from both GMF and MLP branches
- Passes combined representation through an additional hidden layer
- Produces a single scalar prediction corresponding to the expected rating
- Balances linear and non-linear components for optimal performance

This unified architecture leverages both linear and non-linear modeling techniques, combining the interpretability of matrix factorization with the expressiveness of deep neural networks to achieve superior rating prediction accuracy.

For more detailed information about this approach, refer to this comprehensive [Medium Article on NCF](https://medium.com/data-science-in-your-pocket/recommendation-systems-using-neural-collaborative-filtering-ncf-explained-with-codes-21a97e48a2f7).

### Model Variants

Building upon the base NeuMF model, **five distinct implementations** were developed to address different facets of the recommendation problem, recognizing the dual nature of rating prediction as both a classification and regression task.

#### Core NCF Models:

**1. NCF Classification Model**
- **Loss Function**: Cross-Entropy Loss
- **Approach**: Treats rating prediction as a multi-class classification problem
- **Output**: Probability distribution over rating classes (1-5)

### Regularization Techniques

During experimentation, **considerable overfitting** was observed across all models. To address this critical challenge, several advanced regularization techniques were systematically incorporated:

#### Implemented Regularization Strategies:

**1. Dropout Layers**
- **Mechanism**: Randomly deactivate neurons during training
- **Purpose**: Prevent co-adaptation of neurons and reduce overfitting
- **Implementation**: Applied at multiple layers with varying dropout rates
- **Effect**: Improves model generalization to unseen data

**2. Batch Normalization**
- **Mechanism**: Normalize inputs to each layer
- **Purpose**: Stabilize and accelerate convergence
- **Benefits**: Reduces internal covariate shift and acts as implicit regularization
- **Implementation**: Applied after linear transformations, before activation functions

**3. Noise Injection**
- **Mechanism**: Deliberate introduction of controlled noise into training data
- **Purpose**: Improve model robustness and generalization
- **Types**: Gaussian noise added to embeddings and feature vectors
- **Effect**: Forces model to learn more robust representations

**4. Early Stopping**
- **Mechanism**: Monitor validation performance and halt training when overfitting begins
- **Implementation**: Track validation loss with patience parameter
- **Benefit**: Prevents model from memorizing training data

### Hybrid Content-Based Integration

- **Improved Coverage**: Provide recommendations even for less popular items
- **Enhanced Interpretability**: Understand recommendations through content features
- **Robustness**: Reduce dependency on interaction data alone

### Autoencoder-Based Approach

An **Autoencoder-based recommender model** was implemented to explore an alternative paradigm for learning latent representations from both collaborative filtering signals and auxiliary features. This approach was motivated by the flexibility of autoencoders in modeling complex interactions and their potential for unsupervised feature learning.
